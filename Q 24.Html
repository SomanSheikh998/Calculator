        <p style="text-align: center">

            Kawasaki Heavy Industries began producing its first motorcycle engines in 1953, putting to use the advanced development technology and manufacturing knowhow gained through aircraft engine development, and has since produced many iconic machines such as the H1 (500SS Mach-III), Z1 (900 Super Four), Ninja (GPz900R), and in recent years the supercharged Ninja H2. No matter the time period, Kawasaki has remained on the cutting edge of two-wheeled technology, always anticipating the needs of the market and creating products to meet them. This has built up strong recognition and a positive image for the Kawasaki brand..
